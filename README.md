I love making maps, movie, and music. Regarding mapping, I have been using both open source software and python packages, as well as paid software. The open source software I have used are QGIS and Google Earth Pro. The open source python packages and platforms are leafmap, geemap, pandas, geopandas, jupyter lab, git, and github. I have used ArcGIS Pro through my university email. I have used mapping to support Indigenous Nations in Manitoba and Ontario in documenting their traditional land use and occupancy, and traditional ecological knowledge documentation.
